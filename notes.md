# KeyPoints


* Methods to avoid callback hell
    *  Modularise your code, Use generators, Use promises, Use event-driven, Use Async.js
* Promises: A promise represents the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. A promise can be in one of 3 states:
     * Pending - the promise’s outcome hasn’t yet been determined, because the asynchronous operation that will produce its result hasn’t completed yet.
     * Fulfilled - the asynchronous operation has completed, and the promise has a value.
     * Rejected - the asynchronous operation failed, and the promise will never be fulfilled. In the rejected state, a promise has a reason that indicates why the operation failed.
